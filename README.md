# Soltwitter - A Decentralized Twitter
Soltwitter is a decentralized version of [Twitter](https://twitter.com), running on Solana blockchain.
While the code in this repo mostly follows this [tutorial](https://lorisleiva.com/create-a-solana-dapp-from-scratch) by @lorisleiva, I've implemented the frontend part with Next.js which was originally done with Vue.js.

## Work in progress 
Still I need to style more, and add more features.
